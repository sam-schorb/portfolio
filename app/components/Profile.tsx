                    As a Full-Stack Developer, my programming journey began 5 years ago, and the self-directed learning continues every day.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am passionate about developing interesting and memorable experiences that captivate users. I believe that the best way to engage people is by stimulating their imaginations. Whether it&apos;s motivating and teaching young people or building inspiring artistic tools, creative problem-solving is at the heart of everything I do.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After initially learning programming through Digital Signal Processing, I soon taught myself to build innovative musical instruments on embedded systems. My enthusiasm for sharing creative tools with a wider audience led me to Full-Stack Web Development, where I now challenge myself to find inventive uses for every new tool I learn.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Outside the IDE, I love playing with my kids, cooking, hiking, and indulging my passion for musicâ€”I&apos;ve recently managed recording labels, scored a film, and performed live-coded music at the Glastonbury Festival.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I&apos;m currently looking to expand my development skills as part of an ambitious team. Let&apos;s build something amazing together!
