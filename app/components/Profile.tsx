                    I thrive on technically challenging Full-Stack projects - always finding creative uses for new technological advancements. My typical stack is NextJS, Node and MongoDB - deployed using Vercel. Whether it&apos;s motivating and teaching young people or building inspiring artistic tools, creative problem-solving is at the heart of everything I do.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My expertise includes integrating AI into applications; designing innovative and customisable user interfaces; PCB design and manufacturing and writing advanced algorithms for digital signal processing. I have experience implementing a wide range of APIs into applications. My machine and deep learning skills include fine-tuning base models and utilising data science techniques for problem solving.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Outside the IDE, I love playing with my kids, cooking, hiking, and indulging my passion for musicâ€”I&apos;ve recently managed recording labels, scored a film, and performed live-coded music at the Glastonbury Festival.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I&apos;m currently looking to expand my development skills as part of an ambitious team. Let&apos;s build something amazing together!
